                <p class="portfolio-description">We all might be busy living our own lives but we can still find little joys throughout. Little Joys in Life showcases a collection of photographs that depict people in their most natural state of pursuing what they love regardless of how great in size it may be: from getting flowers to playing music.</p></li>
            <li><h4 class="portfolio-section">Process —</h4>
                <p class="portfolio-description">People in these photographs were interviewed prior to their photoshoots to grasp a better understanding of what they are like. All photographs were required to be in black-and-white.</p></li>
