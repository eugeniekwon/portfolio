                    <p class="portfolio-description">For the pictoral logo, the concept of frames and acorns are
                        combined in order to fulfill the purpose of displaying art created by local artists and the
                        location being in the middle of nature. These three colours were chosen to best portray what
                        nature looks and feels like. The key point of this project was simplicity and professionalism.
