            <p>Hello! My name is Eugenie.</p>
            <p>I’m currently a junior at Drexel University, where I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Graphic Design with minors in Marketing and Music. Within the field of graphic design, I am open to exploring different kinds of discipline, although I am currently particularly interested in learning more about brand identity and UI/UX design.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy drawing small illustrations on post-it notes, cooking, singing, taking photos, and getting coffee!</p>
            <p>If you’d like to connect, feel free to send me an email — I’m a night owl, so there’s a chance you’ll receive a reply from me at 2 am, but either way I’ll get back to you soon!</p>
