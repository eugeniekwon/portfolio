                    <p class="portfolio-description">Lüis Barragán was born and raised in Mexico. He considered himself
                        a civil engineer and architect. After finishing his education, he travelled to Europe in order
                        to practice his own studies, which is when he was drawn to landscape architecture. He later
                        focused on creating apartments, residents, and architecture with a focus on landscape. He drew
                        much of his inspiration from the culture and religion of Mexico. </p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-section">Process —</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-description">Out of the many architectural works that Barragan created, one of
                        his most famous, <span>Casa Gilardi</span>, was a big influence in terms of creating the structure. The long
                        hexagons were influenced by his sculpture <span>Torres de Satélite</span>. The colours reflect his style.
                        Futura was chosen as the typeface due to its symmetrical structure.
