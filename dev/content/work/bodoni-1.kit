                    <p class="portfolio-description">Bodoni was created by Giambattista Bodoni in 1798, and was
                        influenced by John Baskerville. During the Neoclassical period, a lot of designs were focused on
                        decorative, elegant aspects as well as on expressing life through art. Bodoni was initially
                        considered a “classic” design, but later came to be seen as “modern” due to the rise in
                        printing. Bodoni is well-known for its dynamic stroke difference between the thick and the thin,
                        which was created with mathematical precision. </p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-section">Process —</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-description">In the early stages, no references to Bodoni’s historical
                        background were applied. Soon after the research phase, a series of motifs and ideas were merged
                        where numerical values, alphabets, and symbols were incorporated in order to reflect the
                        typeface’s history.
