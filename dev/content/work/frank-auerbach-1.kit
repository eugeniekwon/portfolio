                    <h4 class="portfolio-section">About —</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-description">Frank Auerbach is one of the most significant post-war artists
                        based in the UK, and he is well-known for his impasto technique (“thick paint”). He typically
                        paints his daily life: landscapes around him and portraits of his family and friends. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="portfolio-section">Process —</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-description">Frank Auerbach had family and friends as his models for decades,
                        and the central idea was to capture his portraits into one catalog with a “photo album”
                        approach. He only had a small group of people who were models of his portraits, and he titled
                        his artworks as “Head of (name of model)”, often with a roman numeral that follows after it. For
                        this catalog, the sections were divided and curated into the names of the most significant
                        models. All the text is in one location so that the viewer can be more engaged into the
                        paintings. <span>
                        </span>
                        In terms of organizing the paintings for each model, there was special attention towards the
                        placement of images depending on the orientation in which the model posed. It creates more
                        motion between pages and supports as visual cues for viewers to turn the page. In addition,
                        there are a few sections with the folds where the additional layer imitates the “impasto”
                        technique that Auerbach used. </p>
