                    <p class="portfolio-description"><span>Gustav Mahler was one of the major composers of his generation,
                        whose style reflected a blend of Romanticism and Modernism. He was a part of the Vienna
                        Secession, a movement which emphasized the characteristics of expressionism.</span> His
                            composition “Symphony No. 5” starts off more in a minor key, which transitions into a major
                            key; it is considered a marching piece. Out of the five movements, the fourth movement is an
                            exception in that it is the only part that establishes a calm feeling from a series of
                            sustained notes; it is also special due to the fact that it was inspired by his wife, Alma
                            Schindler. The piece ends with a similar momentum that was reflected in previous movements.
                            In its overall shift from minor to major keys, it is also a work that stands as a
                            representation of the trajectory of his personal life.</p>

                    <h4 class="portfolio-section">Process —</h4>
                    <p class="portfolio-description">To portray Mahler’s march, a dynamic scale shift was included to
                        reflect the juxtaposition of both majestic and calming features. There is also a repetition of
                        similar musical motifs, which is represented with the visual motifs of similar shapes at the
                        bottom of the poster. The main poster shows the dark version especially because the entire piece
                        stays in the minor key. Because Mahler was a part of the Vienna Secession, the overall style of
                        the poster was also influenced by the distinctive artist style of this movement, developed among
                        the four major artists and musicians (one of them being Gustav Klimt).</p>
