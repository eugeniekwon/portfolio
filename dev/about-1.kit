            <p>Hello! I'm Eugenie, currently a junior at Drexel University studying Bachelor
                of Science in Graphic Design with minors in Marketing and Music. Within the field of graphic design, I am open to different kinds of discipline although I
                would like to explore more in brand identity and UI/UX design.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy drawing small illustrations on post-its, cooking, singing, taking photos, and
                getting coffee!</p>
            <p>I’m a night owl, so I might or might not be able to read your email at 2am, but send me one anyway; I’ll
                get back to you soon!</p>
